Associate Professor Diep N. Nguyen,Diep_Nguyen.jpg,"Founding-Director, Agile Communications and Computing Group","is currently a faculty member of the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology Sydney (UTS), Australia and holding adjunct positions at other universities in US, Vietnam, Japan. He received M.E. and Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of California San Diego (UCSD) and the University of Arizona (UA), respectively.
His recent research interests are in the areas of computer networking, mobile computing, cyber security, wireless communications (5G/6G), and machine learning/AI application, with emphasis on systems' performance and security/privacy. His work (appeared in more than 150 journal and conference papers, filed patents, technical reports) has attracted more than $4 millions of funding from US National Science Foundation, Raytheon Missile Systems, Australian Research Council, Australia Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), Intel, US Air Force Research Lab, Australia's Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG). Nguyen also contributed to the founding of Food Agility CRC, a $150 million initiative with 30 private sector, government, and research partners to empower Australia's food industry through digital transformation.
Before joining UTS, he was a DECRA Research Fellow at Macquarie University, a member of technical staff at Broadcom (California), ARCON Corporation (Boston), consulting on fast detection of UAVs/aircrafts, air traffic control for FAA. He has received several awards from Australian Research Council, US National Science Foundation, University of Technology Sydney, LG Electronics, University of California San Diego, The University of Arizona, including the UTS Vice-Chancellor’s Awards for Research Excellence (2021), Discovery Early Career Researcher Award (DECRA, 2015), outstanding Early Career Researcher Award (2018, School of Electrical and Data Engineering, University of Technology Sydney). He co-founded and serves as a member of the executive board of UTS Joint Technology and Innovation Research Centers that foster research/technology exchange and collaboration of mutual interest between UTS and its partners (e.g., 5/6G, IoT, cybersecurity, AI, industry 4.0, environmental engineering, sea monitoring systems). Dr. Nguyen also served in the International Advisory Board for Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) DARE (Data Analytics Raising Employment, proposing economy: United States, Department of Labor).
He has co-organized several IEEE and international conferences (e.g., IEEE VTC, INFOCOM, ISMICT, ISCIT, BODYNETS) as TPC chairs, co-chairs, track, session chairs. He has been invited to give keynotes, invited talks, and serve in the TPC committees of various IEEE and international annual flagship conferences, e.g., IEEE LANMAN, ICC, Globecom, WCNC. Dr. Nguyen is a Senior Member of IEEE, an Editor, Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing, IEEE Access, Sensors journal, IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society (OJ-COMS), and Scientific Reports (Nature's).

Dr. Hoang Dinh,Hoang_Dinh.jpg,Co-Director,"received his Ph.D. degree in the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2016. He is currently a faculty member at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), Australia. Over the last ten years, he has significantly contributed to advanced wireless communications and networking systems. His excellent record evidence this with one patent filed by Apple Inc., three books, eight book chapters, nearly 80 IEEE Q1 journals, and more than 60 flagship IEEE conference papers in communications and networking. Most of his journal papers have been published in top IEEE journals, including IEEE JSAC, IEEE TWC, IEEE COMST, and IEEE TMC. Furthermore, his research papers have had a high impact, evidenced by more than 11,000 citations (according to Google Scholar) over the last ten years. Since joining UTS in 2018, he has received more than AUD 3 million in external funding and several precious awards, including the Australian Research Council Discovery Early Career Researcher Award for his project “Intelligent Backscatter Communications for Green and Secure IoT Networks” and IEEE TCSC Award for Excellence in Scalable Computing for Contributions on “Intelligent Mobile Edge Computing Systems” (Early Career Researcher). Alternatively, he is the lead author of two authored books, “Ambient Backscatter Communication Networks,” published by Cambridge Publisher in 2020 and “Deep Reinforcement Learning for Wireless Communications and Networking,” published by IEEE-Wiley Publisher in 2022. He is currently an Associate Editor of IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials and an Editor of IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, and IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking. He also served as a guest editor for several special issues, such as “Deep Reinforcement Learning on Future Wireless Communication Networks” by IEEE TCCN and “Internet of Things for Smart Ocean” by IEEE IoT Journal.",Hoang.Dinh@uts.edu.au,,https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-esKZ8YAAAAJ&hl=en,https://profiles.uts.edu.au/hoang.dinh,
